Picky auth is a plugin for authenticating wordpress users using client certificates. Just configure the webserver to enable SSL Client Certification and pass the client certificate to the PHP script. Optionally, new accounts can be created on the fly by using the email address and name from the certificate.

Acknowledgements: This plugin is based on the [Client Certificate Authentication plugin](http://http://wordpress.org/plugins/client-certificate-authentication/ "Client Certificate Authentication Plugin"). The main difference is that you can configure how client certificates are matched to the logins and/or emails.
